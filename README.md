# Project Aayu 

Team Aayu noticed that the knowledge among the general public about ayurvedic medicinal plants is less nowadays and because of that the indigenous medicinal system has been neglected. The main reason was, there wasn't any easy way to identify ayurvedic medicinal plants by the general public. So Aayu mobile application is introduced to solve the above problem where team Aayu has developed an automated system to identify ayurvedic medicinal plants by scanning the leaves of that plant.

 ## Features of the prototype
 1.  Identify medical plants using a leaf.
    

-   Aayu mobile app will use the camera of the mobile phone and identify ayurvedic plants by scanning its leaf. Then the user can get relevant information regarding the plant.
    

2.  Suggesting other plants with similar qualities.
    

-   After the identification process of the plant, Aayu application will suggest plants to the user with similar qualities. So, the user can compare those plants by considering suggestions.
    

3.  Users can find out the location of the plant when they need it.
    

-   When users enter photos of plants, the location will be tracked and the database will be updated with the location of the plant. Then the user can find locations of medical plants in a medical emergency.
    

4.  The mobile application will display information in global language and a local language in Sri Lanka.
    

-   Users can get major information on ayurvedic plants in global language and a local language in Sri Lanka.
    

5.  Quiz to give some knowledge about the medicinal plants.
    

-   Users can use the Q & A session in Aayu app to enhance the knowledge about medicinal plants. It will be an interactive platform for the younger generation to develop their knowledge about medicinal plants.
